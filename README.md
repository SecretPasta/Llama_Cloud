## System Architecture 🏗️

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Characteristics:

- **Reusability:** Code segments are reused for different purposes, such as loading data from the database.
- **Composability:** The complex task of displaying search results is broken down into smaller tasks like running the scraper, parsing search queries, loading data from the database, and ranking and displaying search results.
